Just leave the app (by tapping Back or Home, or by going to another app), and see how it reacts. Make sure the media volume is turned up.

Don't worry, the app is free of ads, does not require Internet access, and no permissions whatsoever.

### What is autophobia?

[Autophobia](https://www.google.com/search?q=autophobia), also called monophobia, isolophobia, or eremophobia, is the specific phobia of isolation, the fear of abandonment, of being alone or lonely.

### What is a "Hello World" app?

"Hello World" programs and apps are pretty famous, even if all they usually do is write "Hello, World!" on the screen. When learning a new programming language or platform (Kotlin on Android in this case), starting with such a simple app has become a tradition.
